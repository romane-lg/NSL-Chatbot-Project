<h1>⚽ NSL Chatbot – Fan Engagement Tool</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The NSL Chatbot is a Python-based project created for a new Women’s League Soccer team. 
The chatbot allows users to explore the different teams of the league, learn about players, and create a fantasy roster based on player skills using a recommendation system. 

<h2>Datasets Required</h2>
To execute the program flawlessly, the following datasets must be loaded:

- <b>created_teams</b>: Contains previously created fantasy teams from earlier sessions, allowing the chatbot to retrieve and display them.
- <b>all_players</b>: Stores detailed information about all players, including their characteristics and skills, which the chatbot uses to build teams and provide recommendations.
- <b>customer_database</b>: Holds customer information such as email, PIN, and associated teams from previous sessions, enabling the chatbot to manage returning users.
